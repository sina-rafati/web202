<h>1) My art/design portfolio gallery:</h>
      <p>I was thinking this is maybe a good chance to create a webpage to represent my favorite works.</p>
<h>2)NFT:</h>

      <p>I am not sure if this is a good idea but NFTs are trending these days and people buying digital arts at expensive prices. Currently, I am researching NFT to understand why they are expensive? Are NFTs a good investment and useful for the artist? If so, how to invest in NFTs? Also, do they affect the earth's climate? I was thinking I can indicate those issues on my web page.</p>
